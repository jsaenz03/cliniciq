# Deployment Checklist - Image Optimization

## Pre-Deployment Image Optimization Checklist

### ✅ Image Optimization
- [ ] Run `node optimize-images.js` to optimize new images
- [ ] Verify all image variants created (WebP + PNG for each size)
- [ ] Check that responsive variants exist (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Confirm WebP files are 70-85% smaller than originals
- [ ] Validate PNG fallbacks are 20-50% smaller than originals

### ✅ HTML Implementation
- [ ] Update all `<img>` tags to use `<picture>` elements for large images
- [ ] Verify `srcset` and `sizes` attributes are correct
- [ ] Ensure `width` and `height` attributes are included
- [ ] Check `alt` text is descriptive and accurate
- [ ] Confirm `loading="lazy"` is used for non-critical images
- [ ] Verify `loading="eager"` is used for hero/critical images

### ✅ Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Test in Chrome (WebP support)
- [ ] Test in Firefox (WebP support)
- [ ] Test in Safari (WebP support in newer versions)
- [ ] Test in Edge (WebP support)
- [ ] Test fallback behavior (simulate older browsers)
- [ ] Verify picture element support across browsers

### ✅ Responsive Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (should load mobile variants)
- [ ] Test on tablet devices (should load tablet variants)
- [ ] Test on desktop (should load desktop variants)
- [ ] Verify responsive breakpoints work correctly
- [ ] Check image quality on high-DPI displays

### ✅ Performance Validation
- [ ] Run performance measurement script
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals scores
- [ ] Verify LCP improvement (target: <2.5s)
- [ ] Confirm CLS score (target: <0.1)
- [ ] Validate total image payload reduction

### ✅ File Validation
- [ ] Check all image files exist and are accessible
- [ ] Verify no broken image references
- [ ] Confirm file naming convention is followed
- [ ] Validate image dimensions match HTML attributes
- [ ] Check file permissions are correct

### ✅ SEO and Accessibility
- [ ] Verify all images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Check image file names are SEO-friendly
- [ ] Confirm images are properly indexed
- [ ] Validate accessibility of picture elements
- [ ] Test with screen readers

### ✅ Server Configuration
- [ ] Verify WebP MIME type is configured (.webp → image/webp)
- [ ] Check image caching headers are set
- [ ] Confirm CDN supports WebP if applicable
- [ ] Validate compression settings on server

### ✅ Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Ensure performance measurement script is included
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals tracking is active
- [ ] Verify image load time monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for image loading failures

### ✅ Documentation
- [ ] Update image inventory documentation
- [ ] Record performance improvements
- [ ] Document any issues and resolutions
- [ ] Update team on new image optimization process

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals for 48 hours post-deployment
- [ ] Check for any image loading errors in browser console
- [ ] Verify mobile performance improvements
- [ ] Monitor server bandwidth usage

### User Experience
- [ ] Test on various devices and connection speeds
- [ ] Verify no visual quality degradation
- [ ] Check for any layout shifts or broken layouts
- [ ] Confirm responsive images work as expected

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered:
1. [ ] Revert to original images from backup
2. [ ] Restore original HTML img tags
3. [ ] Remove performance measurement scripts if causing issues
4. [ ] Document issues for future optimization attempts

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Total image payload reduced by ≥60%
- ✅ LCP improved by ≥50%
- ✅ All Core Web Vitals in "Good" range
- ✅ No broken images or layout issues
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility maintained
- ✅ Mobile experience significantly improved

## Notes
- Keep original images in backup for potential rollback
- Monitor performance for 1 week post-deployment
- Update this checklist as optimization process evolves
- Consider automating parts of this checklist in CI/CD pipeline
