# SEO Optimization Completion Proposal

## Why

The ClinicIQ website has completed Phase 1 SEO critical fixes (meta descriptions, title tags, sitemap, and alt text improvements). However, significant SEO gaps remain that prevent the site from ranking competitively for target healthcare automation keywords. The current SEO score is 5.5/10 with several high-priority issues unresolved:

- Missing canonical tags (duplicate content risk)
- No JSON-LD structured data (missing rich snippet opportunities)
- Thin content on service pages (not competitive for search rankings)
- No internal linking between services (poor page authority distribution)
- Missing content hub (blog, case studies, testimonials)

## What Changes

### Phase 2: Technical On-Page Optimization (Week 1)
- **ADD**: Canonical tags to all 6 main HTML pages
- **FIX**: Heading hierarchy on /downloads (convert H3 category headers to H2)
- **ADD**: Cross-linking between service pages (contextual internal links)
- **FIX**: One remaining alt text issue (MedPlan AI image)

### Phase 3: Structured Data Implementation (Week 2)
- **ADD**: Organization schema JSON-LD to all pages
- **ADD**: SoftwareApplication schema for all 8 automation products
- **ADD**: BreadcrumbList schema for navigation pages
- **ADD**: LocalBusiness schema with Wollongong address

### Phase 4: Content Expansion (Weeks 3-4)
- **EXPAND**: /websites page content from ~100 to 500+ words
- **EXPAND**: Product descriptions on /automations (add features, use cases, outcomes)
- **CREATE**: Blog section with first 3 posts
- **CREATE**: FAQ page with 8-10 common questions
- **ADD**: Testimonial section to homepage

### Phase 5: Advanced SEO (Week 5)
- **CREATE**: Glossary page for healthcare automation terms
- **ADD**: Case study to /websites (Gong Cafe project)
- **CREATE**: Resource hub landing pages for /downloads categories
- **ADD**: Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
