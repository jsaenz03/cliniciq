# Image Optimization Implementation Tasks

## 1. Preparation and Analysis
- [ ] 1.1 Create backup of original images before optimization
- [ ] 1.2 Document current image sizes and formats for comparison
- [ ] 1.3 Set up performance baseline measurements (LCP, total image payload)
- [ ] 1.4 Identify which images need responsive variants vs single-size optimization

## 2. Image Optimization
- [ ] 2.1 Optimize services images (automations.png, calculators.png, downloads.png, websites.png)
  - [ ] Convert to WebP format (85% quality)
  - [ ] Create PNG fallbacks (80% quality)
  - [ ] Generate 3 sizes: mobile (640w), tablet (1024w), desktop (1920w)
- [ ] 2.2 Optimize hero image (top.png)
  - [ ] Convert to WebP with PNG fallback
  - [ ] Create responsive variants
- [ ] 2.3 Optimize about image (about-office-workspace.png)
  - [ ] Convert to WebP with PNG fallback
  - [ ] Create responsive variants
- [ ] 2.4 Optimize logo (cliniciq-logo.png)
  - [ ] Convert to WebP with PNG fallback
  - [ ] Keep single size (suitable for all devices)

## 3. HTML Markup Updates
- [ ] 3.1 Update index.html hero section with `<picture>` element
- [ ] 3.2 Update services sections across all pages with responsive images
- [ ] 3.3 Update about section with responsive images
- [ ] 3.4 Update logo usage with modern format support
- [ ] 3.5 Add width/height attributes to prevent layout shift (CLS)
- [ ] 3.6 Test fallback behavior for older browsers

## 4. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] 4.1 Add performance measurement script to track image load times
- [ ] 4.2 Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] 4.3 Create before/after performance comparison report
- [ ] 4.4 Set up ongoing monitoring for image performance

## 5. Cleanup and Validation
- [ ] 5.1 Remove unused placeholder images (testimonials, portfolio placeholders)
- [ ] 5.2 Validate all image references work correctly
- [ ] 5.3 Test responsive image behavior across devices
- [ ] 5.4 Verify WebP format support and fallback behavior
- [ ] 5.5 Cross-browser testing for picture element support

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] 6.1 Document optimization process for future images
- [ ] 6.2 Create image optimization guidelines
- [ ] 6.3 Update deployment checklist to include image optimization step
- [ ] 6.4 Document performance improvements achieved
