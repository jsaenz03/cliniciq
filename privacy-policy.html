                    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p><strong>Australian-First Approach:</strong> ClinicIQ Solutions prioritizes keeping your personal information within Australia whenever possible. However, to provide our comprehensive automation and website services, your personal information may occasionally need to be transferred to and stored on servers located outside Australia.</p>

                    <p><strong>Third-Party Service Dependencies:</strong> Some essential services we use (such as cloud hosting providers, analytics platforms, or communication tools) may operate outside Australia. These transfers are necessary for service delivery but are carefully managed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Our Protection Commitments:</strong> When international transfers occur, we implement the following safeguards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> All transfers comply with Australian Privacy Principle 8 (APP 8)</li>
                        <li><strong>Contractual Safeguards:</strong> We require overseas recipients to provide protection substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles</li>
                        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We maintain appropriate security measures regardless of where data is stored</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We will inform you when international transfers are required for specific services</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> While we take every reasonable step to protect your information internationally, including implementing robust contractual and technical safeguards, we cannot be held responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Actions of foreign governments or legal requirements in other jurisdictions</li>
                        <li>Security breaches of third-party international service providers outside our direct control</li>
                        <li>Changes to international laws or regulations that affect data protection</li>
                        <li>Interception or access to data during international transmission</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Your Choice:</strong> If you have concerns about international data transfers, please contact us to discuss alternative service arrangements where available.</p>
