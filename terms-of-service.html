                    <h2>12. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
                    <p><strong>Privacy Commitment:</strong> Your privacy is important to us. Our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Australian Compliance:</strong> We comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and Australian Privacy Principles in handling your personal information.</p>

                    <p><strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> While we prioritize keeping your data within Australia, our services may require transferring data to international service providers. We implement appropriate safeguards, but please note:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We cannot be held responsible for actions of foreign governments or legal requirements in other jurisdictions</li>
                        <li>We are not liable for security breaches of international third-party providers outside our direct control</li>
                        <li>Data protection laws vary significantly between countries, and some may not offer the same level of protection as Australian law</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Third-Party Service Limitations:</strong> Our services rely on third-party providers (hosting, analytics, communication tools). While we carefully select these providers, we:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cannot guarantee the security or availability of third-party services</li>
                        <li>Are not responsible for data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access in third-party systems</li>
                        <li>Cannot control how foreign governments may access data stored with international providers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> By using our services, you acknowledge and accept these limitations regarding international data transfers and third-party service dependencies.</p>
